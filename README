Braindamage - A Brainfuck interpreter written in Rust.


More about Brainfuck can be read on its wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
The interpreter is the stock implementation of Brainfuck, meaning the buffer has a size of 30'000 and the type u8.
Comments are allowed in form of any characters that are not keywords (> < + - . , [ ]).

This project is split into two parts:
 - The library that handles parsing and interpreting
 - A small binary that provides a simple cli

You can run the cli by running `cargo run --release -- --help` or by building the project with `cargo build --release` and executing the binary in `./target/release/braindamage-cli`.

There are a couple of example brainfuck programs in the `examples` folder which you can run with `braindamage-cli -f examples/hello-world.b`.



Compiling brainfuck to native code is now also supported with the help of `nasm`. The program will generate an assembly file, compile it using `nasm` and link it using `ld`. This process was only tested on linux.
If you would like to compile a brainfuck program run the following command: `braindamage-cli -f path/to/file.b -c -o program.out`.
Requirements for this process are: 
 - Have `nasm` in your path
 - Have `ld` in your path
